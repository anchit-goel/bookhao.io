                <h3>Fiction</h3>
                <p>Fiction is any creative work, chiefly any narrative work, portraying people,
                     events, or places in imaginary ways that are not strictly based on history or fact.
                      In its most narrow usage, fiction applies to written narratives in prose and often 
                      specifically novels, as well as novellas and short stories.</p>

                <h3>Non-Fiction</h3>
                <p>Nonfiction is any document or media content that intends, in good faith,
                     to present only truth and accuracy regarding information, events, or people. 
                     Nonfictional content may be presented either objectively or subjectively.</p>

            <div class="ebooks-col">
                <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                <p>Inspiration is an unconscious burst of creativity in a literary, musical, or visual art 
                    and other artistic endeavours. The concept has origins in both Hellenism and Hebraism.
                     The Greeks believed that inspiration or "enthusiasm" came from the muses, as well as
                      the gods Apollo and Dionysus.</p>
